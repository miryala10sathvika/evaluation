  "Clarity": {
    "rating": "Partially Meets Expectations",
    "justification": "The generated diagram uses icons and colors that make it visually appealing, but it lacks textual labels for some components, which could make it less understandable for non-technical stakeholders. The layout is logical, but the absence of specific labels like 'Web UI' and 'WebSocket Client' reduces clarity."

  "Completeness": {
    "rating": "Partially Meets Expectations",
    "justification": "The generated diagram includes most components from the ground truth, such as the backend services and databases. However, it misses some elements like 'Web UI', 'WebSocket Client', and 'Jaeger'. Additionally, the connections between components are not as detailed."
  },
  "Consistency": {
    "rating": "Partially Meets Expectations",
    "justification": "The generated diagram maintains a consistent style with icons and colors, but it does not fully align with the structural and semantic elements of the ground truth diagram. The use of icons instead of text labels creates inconsistency in representation."
