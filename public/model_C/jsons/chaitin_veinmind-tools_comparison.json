    "rating": "Partially Meets Expectations",
    "justification": "The generated diagram uses clear labels and a structured layout, but it is more complex and detailed than the ground truth, which may reduce clarity for non-technical stakeholders. The additional components and connections could be overwhelming."

  "Completeness": {
    "rating": "Does Not Meet Expectations",
    "justification": "The generated diagram includes many elements not present in the ground truth, such as specific plugins and CI/CD pipeline components, while missing others like the 'SDK' and 'interact system'. This results in a significant deviation from the ground truth."

  "Consistency": {
    "rating": "Does Not Meet Expectations",
    "justification": "The generated diagram uses different styles, symbols, and naming conventions compared to the ground truth. The structural and semantic alignment is lacking, as the generated diagram introduces new categories and components not present in the ground truth."
