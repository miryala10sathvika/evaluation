  "Clarity": {
    "rating": "Partially Meets Expectations",
    "justification": "The generated diagram uses clear symbols and labels, but the layout is less intuitive compared to the ground truth. The arrangement of components is more linear and less structured, which might make it harder for stakeholders to follow the flow of information."

  "Completeness": {
    "rating": "Does Not Meet Expectations",
    "justification": "The generated diagram is missing several components and connections present in the ground truth, such as the 'Secret Store', 'Authorization Service', and 'Monitoring and Alerting Service'. Additionally, the interactions between components are not fully represented."

  "Consistency": {
    "rating": "Partially Meets Expectations",
    "justification": "The generated diagram maintains some consistency in the use of symbols and styles, but it diverges significantly from the structure and semantics of the ground truth diagram. Key components and their interactions are not consistently represented."
