  "Clarity": {
    "rating": "Partially Meets Expectations",
    "justification": "The generated diagram uses clear labels and connections, but the layout is more complex and may be harder for non-technical stakeholders to follow. The ground truth diagram has a simpler, more straightforward layout."
  },
  "Completeness": {
    "rating": "Does Not Meet Expectations",
    "justification": "The generated diagram includes additional components like 'Web Server' and 'DAG Scheduler' that are not present in the ground truth. It also lacks the 'Amazon EC2' component and the specific data flow steps (1, 2, 3) shown in the ground truth."
  },
  "Consistency": {
    "rating": "Partially Meets Expectations",
    "justification": "The generated diagram uses different styles and notations compared to the ground truth. While some components like 'Amazon Redshift' and 'Apache Spark' are consistent, others like 'Amazon S3' are labeled differently ('S3 Bucket')."
