    "justification": "The generated diagram includes most components from the ground truth but misses specific interactions, such as the 'Fetch information from ES and sends mail' detail. The paths and endpoints are slightly different, such as '/salary' vs. '/salary/**'."

  "Consistency": {
    "rating": "Partially Meets Expectations",
    "justification": "The generated diagram uses different styles and notations compared to the ground truth. While the structure is somewhat aligned, the use of different symbols and naming conventions affects consistency. The connectors and flow directions are mostly consistent but not entirely aligned with the ground truth."
