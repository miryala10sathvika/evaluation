  "Completeness": {
    "rating": "Partially Meets Expectations",
    "justification": "The generated diagram includes additional components like 'Slack Facade', 'URL Parser', and 'Result Aggregator', which are not present in the ground truth. It also lacks specific regional worker labels present in the ground truth."
