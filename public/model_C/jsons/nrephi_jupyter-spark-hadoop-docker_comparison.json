  "Completeness": {
    "rating": "Does Not Meet Expectations",
    "justification": "The generated diagram is missing several components present in the ground truth, such as MySQL (Hue), Hive Server, Hive Metastore, and PostgreSQL (Hive). Additionally, the connections and interactions between components are not fully represented."
