    "rating": "Partially Meets Expectations",
    "justification": "The generated diagram captures the main components and interactions but misses some details present in the ground truth, such as specific function calls and the subscription update mechanism. It also lacks the visual representation of the user interface and device."

  "Consistency": {
    "rating": "Partially Meets Expectations",
    "justification": "The generated diagram maintains consistent styling and notation within itself but deviates from the ground truth in terms of structural representation and component naming. For instance, 'AWS AppSync' is used instead of 'GraphQL Request/Response', and the interactions are labeled differently."
