  "Clarity": {
    "rating": "Partially Meets Expectations",
    "justification": "The generated diagram uses different styles and notations compared to the ground truth, which may cause confusion. While it is understandable, the use of UML stereotypes and labels like 'Protected by' and 'Injected into' may not be as clear to non-technical stakeholders as the icons and labels in the ground truth."

  "Completeness": {
    "rating": "Partially Meets Expectations",
    "justification": "The generated diagram captures the main components and their relationships, such as the web application, firewall, and SQL database. However, it lacks some specific elements like 'App Gateway WAF', 'Peering', and 'Private DNS Zones' present in the ground truth. Additionally, the connections to the Internet are not depicted."
  },
  "Consistency": {
    "rating": "Does Not Meet Expectations",
    "justification": "The generated diagram uses a different notation style (UML) compared to the ground truth, which uses Azure-specific icons and layout. This inconsistency in style and notation can lead to misunderstandings, as stakeholders familiar with the Azure architecture might expect the latter's visual language."
