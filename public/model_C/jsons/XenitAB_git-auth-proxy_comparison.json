  "Clarity": {
    "rating": "Partially Meets Expectations",
    "justification": "The generated diagram uses clear labels and logical layout, but the complexity and additional components compared to the ground truth may make it less understandable to non-technical stakeholders. The inclusion of detailed processes and interactions adds clarity for technical stakeholders but could overwhelm others."
  },
  "Completeness": {
    "rating": "Does Not Meet Expectations",
    "justification": "The generated diagram includes many additional components and interactions not present in the ground truth, such as Kubernetes Cluster, Metrics, Token Writer, and others. It also lacks the specific repositories and token details shown in the ground truth."
  },
  "Consistency": {
    "rating": "Does Not Meet Expectations",
    "justification": "The generated diagram is structurally and semantically different from the ground truth. It introduces new elements and omits key components like specific repositories and token flows, leading to inconsistency in representation."
