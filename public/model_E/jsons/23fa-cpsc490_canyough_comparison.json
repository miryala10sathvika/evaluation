  "Clarity": {
    "rating": "Partially Meets Expectations",
    "justification": "The generated diagram uses clear symbols and labels, but the layout is different from the ground truth, which may confuse stakeholders familiar with the original structure. The icons are visually appealing but may not be immediately clear to non-technical stakeholders without a legend."
  },
  "Completeness": {
    "rating": "Does Not Meet Expectations",
    "justification": "The generated diagram is missing several components and connections present in the ground truth diagram. Key elements like 'Tech Stack', 'Flow Registration', and 'Flow Definition' are absent, leading to an incomplete representation of the architecture."
  },
  "Consistency": {
    "rating": "Does Not Meet Expectations",
    "justification": "The generated diagram does not maintain consistency with the ground truth in terms of structure and semantics. The use of different styles and symbols, along with missing components, results in a lack of alignment with the original diagram."
