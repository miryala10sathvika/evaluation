  "Clarity": {
    "rating": "Partially Meets Expectations",
    "justification": "The generated diagram uses different symbols and icons which may not be immediately clear to all stakeholders. While it is visually appealing, the complexity and use of specific icons (e.g., Docker, PostgreSQL) may require additional explanation for non-technical stakeholders. The layout is logical but more complex than the ground truth."
  },
  "Completeness": {
    "rating": "Does Not Meet Expectations",
    "justification": "The generated diagram includes additional components not present in the ground truth, such as Docker, PostgreSQL, MySQL, and a message queue. It also omits specific elements from the ground truth like JupyterLab and the simulated Hadoop distributed file system. The connections and components do not match the ground truth."
  },
  "Consistency": {
    "rating": "Does Not Meet Expectations",
    "justification": "The generated diagram is not consistent with the ground truth in terms of structure and components. It introduces new layers and components, uses different styles and notations, and lacks alignment with the ground truth's simpler structure."
