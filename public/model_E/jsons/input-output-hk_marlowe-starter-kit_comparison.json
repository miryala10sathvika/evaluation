  "Clarity": {
    "rating": "Partially Meets Expectations",
    "justification": "The generated diagram uses clear labels and a straightforward layout, but lacks the color coding and detailed labeling present in the ground truth. This makes it less accessible to non-technical stakeholders who might benefit from visual cues."
  },
  "Completeness": {
    "rating": "Does Not Meet Expectations",
    "justification": "The generated diagram omits several components and connections present in the ground truth, such as specific client types, the database schema, and various interactions. This results in a loss of critical information necessary for a full understanding of the architecture."
  },
  "Consistency": {
    "rating": "Does Not Meet Expectations",
    "justification": "The generated diagram lacks consistency with the ground truth in terms of structure and semantics. The components and interactions are not aligned, and the use of symbols and styles is different, leading to a disconnect between the two diagrams."
