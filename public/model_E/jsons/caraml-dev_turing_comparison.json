  "Clarity": {
    "rating": "Partially Meets Expectations",
    "justification": "The generated diagram uses different terminology and layout compared to the ground truth, which may cause confusion. Some labels are not as descriptive, and the layout is more complex, making it harder to follow for non-technical stakeholders."

  "Completeness": {
    "rating": "Does Not Meet Expectations",
    "justification": "The generated diagram is missing several components and connections present in the ground truth, such as the Secret Store, Authorization Service, and specific interactions with the Turing System. It also introduces new elements not present in the ground truth, like the Batch Ensemble and Tracing."

  "Consistency": {
    "rating": "Does Not Meet Expectations",
    "justification": "The generated diagram lacks consistency with the ground truth in terms of symbols, notations, and structure. The components and their interactions are represented differently, leading to a lack of alignment with the original diagram."
