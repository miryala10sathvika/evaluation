    "rating": "Meets Expectations",
    "justification": "The generated diagram is clear and understandable. It uses recognizable icons and labels for each component, such as 'API Gateway', 'Todo Lambda', and 'Todo Table'. The layout is logical, showing the flow from the web client to backend services."

  "Completeness": {
    "rating": "Partially Meets Expectations",
    "justification": "The generated diagram includes most of the key components from the ground truth, such as the API Gateway and Lambda function. However, it lacks explicit mention of CRUD operations and does not clearly depict the S3 bucket for frontend hosting, although it is implied by 'Static Website'."

  "Consistency": {
    "rating": "Partially Meets Expectations",
    "justification": "The generated diagram uses consistent styles and symbols, but there are differences in the representation of components compared to the ground truth. For example, the database icon differs, and the layout of components is slightly different, which could affect structural alignment."
