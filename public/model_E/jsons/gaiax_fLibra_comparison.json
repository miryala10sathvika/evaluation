  "Clarity": {
    "rating": "Partially Meets Expectations",
    "justification": "The generated diagram uses clear labels and a structured layout, but the symbols and icons are not as intuitive as those in the ground truth. Some components, like the blockchain elements, are less clearly represented, which may confuse non-technical stakeholders."

  "Completeness": {
    "rating": "Does Not Meet Expectations",
    "justification": "The generated diagram is missing several key components present in the ground truth, such as the GAE, Node.js, and AES components. Additionally, the connections between components are not fully represented, leading to an incomplete depiction of the architecture."

  "Consistency": {
    "rating": "Does Not Meet Expectations",
    "justification": "The generated diagram lacks consistency with the ground truth in terms of symbols and layout. The structure and flow of information are different, and the use of icons and labels is not uniform, leading to a lack of alignment with the original diagram."
