    "justification": "The generated diagram uses different terminology and layout compared to the ground truth. While it is understandable, the labels and components differ, which may cause confusion. The arrangement is logical, but the naming conventions are not consistent with the ground truth."

  "Completeness": {
    "rating": "Does Not Meet Expectations",
    "justification": "The generated diagram is missing several components and connections present in the ground truth, such as the Configuration Loader, Kubernetes Secret Management, and Token Management. It also lacks specific interactions like 'Load Config' and 'Secret Changes'."

  "Consistency": {
    "rating": "Does Not Meet Expectations",
    "justification": "The generated diagram uses different symbols, styles, and notations compared to the ground truth. The structural and semantic alignment is weak due to the absence of several elements and the introduction of new ones not present in the ground truth."
