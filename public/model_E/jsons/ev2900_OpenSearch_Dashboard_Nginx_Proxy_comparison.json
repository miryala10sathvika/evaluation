  "Clarity": {
    "rating": "Partially Meets Expectations",
    "justification": "The generated diagram uses clear labels and a legend, which aids understanding. However, the layout is more linear and less intuitive than the ground truth, which might confuse non-technical stakeholders. The use of colors for different components is helpful but not as clear as the icons used in the ground truth."
  },
  "Completeness": {
    "rating": "Partially Meets Expectations",
    "justification": "The generated diagram includes most of the key components like the Nginx server and OpenSearch domain, but it lacks some elements such as the IAM Role and Internet Gateway. The interactions between components are depicted differently, which might lead to misunderstandings about the architecture."
  },
  "Consistency": {
    "rating": "Partially Meets Expectations",
    "justification": "The generated diagram maintains a consistent style with color coding and a legend, but it does not align structurally with the ground truth. The use of different symbols and styles for similar components reduces consistency across the diagrams."
