  "Clarity": {
    "rating": "Partially Meets Expectations",
    "justification": "The generated diagram is generally understandable, but it lacks some of the detailed labels and directional arrows present in the ground truth. The layout is linear and straightforward, which aids clarity, but some components are not as clearly labeled or differentiated as in the ground truth."
  },
  "Completeness": {
    "rating": "Does Not Meet Expectations",
    "justification": "The generated diagram is missing several components and connections present in the ground truth, such as the DNS Zones, Peering, and UDR. Additionally, the connections to the Internet and the specific subnets are not depicted, leading to a lack of completeness."
  },
  "Consistency": {
    "rating": "Partially Meets Expectations",
    "justification": "While the generated diagram uses consistent styles and symbols, it does not fully align with the ground truth in terms of structural and semantic elements. The naming conventions and some symbols differ, and the arrangement of components is not consistent with the ground truth."
