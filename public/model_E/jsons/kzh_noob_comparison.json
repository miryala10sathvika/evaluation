    "rating": "Partially Meets Expectations",
    "justification": "The generated diagram includes most components like Kubernetes, Redis, MongoDB, and RabbitMQ. However, it is missing some elements such as Jaeger (Tracing) and specific labels for connections, which are present in the ground truth diagram."

    "rating": "Partially Meets Expectations",
    "justification": "The generated diagram maintains a consistent style with icons and colors, but it does not fully align with the structure and semantic details of the ground truth diagram, such as the missing Jaeger component and the lack of labeled connections."
