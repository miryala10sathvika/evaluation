  "Clarity": {
    "rating": "Partially Meets Expectations",
    "justification": "The generated diagram uses different symbols and labels, which might confuse stakeholders unfamiliar with these terms. While the layout is logical, the use of terms like 'Docker Container Environment' and 'Data Quality Checks' without further explanation could be unclear to non-technical stakeholders."

  "Completeness": {
    "rating": "Does Not Meet Expectations",
    "justification": "The generated diagram includes additional components such as 'Docker Container Environment' and 'PostgreSQL Metadata DB' that are not present in the ground truth. It also omits the explicit mention of 'Amazon EC2' and 'Staging' in 'Amazon S3', which are present in the ground truth diagram."

  "Consistency": {
    "rating": "Does Not Meet Expectations",
    "justification": "The generated diagram is not structurally or semantically aligned with the ground truth. Different terminologies and components are used, such as 'Data Lake' instead of 'Data Storage', and 'Data Quality Checks' which are not present in the ground truth. The style and notation differ significantly, affecting consistency."
