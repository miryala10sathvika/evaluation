    "rating": "Does Not Meet Expectations",
    "justification": "The generated diagram includes different components and connections than the ground truth. Key elements from the original diagram, such as 'Watson Studio' and 'Jupyter', are missing, and new elements unrelated to the ground truth are present."

  "Consistency": {
    "rating": "Does Not Meet Expectations",
    "justification": "There is a lack of consistency in terms of structure and semantics between the two diagrams. The generated diagram introduces new styles and notations that are not present in the ground truth, leading to a disconnect in representation."
