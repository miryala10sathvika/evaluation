    "rating": "Partially Meets Expectations",
    "justification": "The generated diagram includes most of the key components and interactions, but some elements and connections are missing or represented differently. For example, the subscription update and specific function calls are not as explicitly shown."

  "Consistency": {
    "rating": "Does Not Meet Expectations",
    "justification": "The generated diagram lacks consistency with the ground truth in terms of symbols, styles, and notations. The structural and semantic alignment is weak, with different representations for similar components and interactions."
