    "rating": "Partially Meets Expectations",
    "justification": "The generated diagram includes additional components like Vue Components, Vuex Store, and IPFS, which are not present in the ground truth. While it captures the main elements, it introduces new ones that may not be necessary, potentially deviating from the intended scope."

  "Consistency": {
    "rating": "Partially Meets Expectations",
    "justification": "There are inconsistencies in the use of symbols and components between the diagrams. The generated diagram uses different styles and notations, such as plugins and services, which are not present in the ground truth. This affects structural and semantic alignment."
