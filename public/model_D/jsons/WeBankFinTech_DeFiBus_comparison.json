  "Clarity": {
    "rating": "Does Not Meet Expectations",
    "justification": "The generated diagram is significantly different from the ground truth. It lacks clarity for non-technical stakeholders due to its complex structure and technical jargon. The arrangement and labeling of components do not align with the ground truth, making it difficult to understand the architecture."
  },
  "Completeness": {
    "rating": "Does Not Meet Expectations",
    "justification": "The generated diagram is missing many elements present in the ground truth, such as the 'Bus', 'APP', and 'DB' layers. It also lacks the descriptive labels and connections that explain the architecture's functionality, leading to an incomplete representation."
  },
  "Consistency": {
    "rating": "Does Not Meet Expectations",
    "justification": "There is a lack of consistency between the generated diagram and the ground truth. The symbols, styles, and notations are not aligned, and the structural layout is entirely different. This inconsistency makes it difficult to relate the two diagrams."
