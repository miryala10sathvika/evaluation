  "Clarity": {
    "rating": "Partially Meets Expectations",
    "justification": "The generated diagram uses clear labels and components, but the layout is more complex and may be harder for non-technical stakeholders to understand compared to the ground truth. The use of specific operators and scripts adds detail but may not be necessary for all audiences."
  },
  "Completeness": {
    "rating": "Does Not Meet Expectations",
    "justification": "The generated diagram includes additional elements like specific operators and scripts that are not present in the ground truth. It also lacks some components such as Amazon EC2 and the staging process in Amazon S3, which are present in the ground truth."
  },
  "Consistency": {
    "rating": "Does Not Meet Expectations",
    "justification": "The generated diagram uses different symbols, styles, and notations compared to the ground truth. It introduces new elements and omits others, leading to a lack of structural and semantic alignment with the ground truth diagram."
