    "rating": "Partially Meets Expectations",
    "justification": "The generated diagram is more complex and includes additional components and interactions that are not present in the ground truth. While it provides more information, it might be overwhelming for non-technical stakeholders. The layout is less straightforward, and some labels and connections could be clearer."

  "Completeness": {
    "rating": "Does Not Meet Expectations",
    "justification": "The generated diagram includes many additional elements like Docker components and databases that are not present in the ground truth. It also lacks the specific focus on the Spark cluster and JupyterLab interaction shown in the ground truth."

  "Consistency": {
    "rating": "Does Not Meet Expectations",
    "justification": "The generated diagram uses different styles, symbols, and notations compared to the ground truth. The structural and semantic alignment with the ground truth is lacking, as the focus and components differ significantly."
