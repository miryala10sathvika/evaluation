  "Clarity": {
    "rating": "Partially Meets Expectations",
    "justification": "The generated diagram uses a sequence flow format, which is different from the component-based format of the ground truth. While it provides detailed process flows, it might be less intuitive for non-technical stakeholders compared to the simpler component layout of the ground truth."

  "Completeness": {
    "rating": "Partially Meets Expectations",
    "justification": "The generated diagram includes all major components but focuses more on process flows rather than the structural relationships between components. Some interactions and data flows present in the ground truth are not explicitly depicted in the generated diagram."
  },
  "Consistency": {
    "rating": "Does Not Meet Expectations",
    "justification": "The generated diagram uses a different style and notation, focusing on sequence flows rather than component interactions. This results in a lack of structural and semantic alignment with the ground truth diagram."
