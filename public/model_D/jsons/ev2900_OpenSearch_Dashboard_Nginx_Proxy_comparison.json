  "Clarity": {
    "rating": "Partially Meets Expectations",
    "justification": "The generated diagram is somewhat clear but could be improved. The layout is logical, but the labels and symbols are less descriptive compared to the ground truth. The use of icons and labels could be more explicit to enhance understanding for non-technical stakeholders."
  },
  "Completeness": {
    "rating": "Partially Meets Expectations",
    "justification": "The generated diagram includes several key components from the ground truth, such as the VPC, EC2 instance, and OpenSearch Domain. However, it lacks some specific elements like the IAM Role, Internet Gateway, and Security Groups, which are explicitly shown in the ground truth."
  },
  "Consistency": {
    "rating": "Does Not Meet Expectations",
    "justification": "The generated diagram uses different styles and notations compared to the ground truth. The structural alignment is different, and some components are represented differently, leading to inconsistencies in how the architecture is depicted."
