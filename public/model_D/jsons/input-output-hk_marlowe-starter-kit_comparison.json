  "Clarity": {
    "rating": "Does Not Meet Expectations",
    "justification": "The generated diagram is a sequence diagram, while the ground truth is a component architecture diagram. The styles and formats are completely different, making it difficult for stakeholders to understand the architecture from the generated diagram. The components, connectors, and layout are not comparable to the ground truth."

  "Completeness": {
    "rating": "Does Not Meet Expectations",
    "justification": "The generated diagram lacks the components and connections present in the ground truth. It does not include any of the specific components like 'marlowe-web-server', 'marlowe-runtime-cli', or 'marlowe-proxy'. Instead, it focuses on a different aspect of the system, such as interactions and processes, rather than the architecture."
  },
  "Consistency": {
    "rating": "Does Not Meet Expectations",
    "justification": "There is no consistency between the diagrams as they represent different types of information. The ground truth diagram uses specific symbols and layouts for architectural components, while the generated diagram uses a sequence diagram format, which is not aligned with the ground truth."
