    "rating": "Partially Meets Expectations",
    "justification": "The generated diagram includes detailed annotations and labels, which enhance understanding for technical stakeholders. However, the complexity and density of information might overwhelm non-technical stakeholders. The layout is logical but could be simplified for broader accessibility."

    "rating": "Partially Meets Expectations",
    "justification": "The generated diagram includes additional components like the S3 bucket and GitHub Actions workflow, which are not present in the ground truth. While these elements provide more context, they deviate from the original scope, potentially leading to confusion about the core architecture."
