    "rating": "Partially Meets Expectations",
    "justification": "The generated diagram is complex and may be difficult for non-technical stakeholders to understand. While it uses clear labels and logical groupings, the numerous connections and overlapping lines can be confusing. The layout is more intricate compared to the ground truth, which is simpler and more straightforward."

  "Completeness": {
    "rating": "Partially Meets Expectations",
    "justification": "The generated diagram includes additional elements and layers not present in the ground truth, such as 'External Interfaces' and 'Testing Framework'. However, it lacks some specific components like 'Winograd' and 'Sgemm' from the ground truth. This results in both missing and extra elements compared to the ground truth."

  "Consistency": {
    "rating": "Does Not Meet Expectations",
    "justification": "The generated diagram uses different styles and structures compared to the ground truth. The components and layers are organized differently, and the notations and connectors do not align with the ground truth. The structural differences are significant, affecting consistency."
