  "Clarity": {
    "rating": "Does Not Meet Expectations",
    "justification": "The generated diagram is a sequence diagram, while the ground truth is a component architecture diagram. This makes it difficult for stakeholders to understand the architecture as the formats are entirely different. The sequence diagram format is not suitable for conveying the same information as the component-based architecture diagram."

  "Completeness": {
    "rating": "Does Not Meet Expectations",
    "justification": "The generated diagram lacks the components and connections present in the ground truth diagram. It focuses on interaction flows rather than architectural components, missing elements like 'Turing System', 'Router Endpoints', 'Secret Store', 'Authorization Service', etc."
  },
  "Consistency": {
    "rating": "Does Not Meet Expectations",
    "justification": "There is no consistency between the diagrams as they use different diagram types and notations. The generated diagram does not align with the structural and semantic elements of the ground truth diagram, making it inconsistent in style and purpose."
