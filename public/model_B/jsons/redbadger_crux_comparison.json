    "justification": "The generated diagram is complex with numerous components and connections, making it difficult for non-technical stakeholders to understand. The labels and components are not as clear and descriptive as in the ground truth diagram, which uses simpler terms and a more straightforward layout."

  "Completeness": {
    "rating": "Does Not Meet Expectations",
    "justification": "The generated diagram includes many additional components and details not present in the ground truth diagram, such as specific capabilities and platform services. It also lacks some elements from the ground truth, like the clear flow from 'User interaction' to 'UI'."

  "Consistency": {
    "rating": "Does Not Meet Expectations",
    "justification": "The generated diagram uses different styles, symbols, and notations compared to the ground truth. The structural and semantic alignment is poor, with the generated diagram presenting a more detailed and technical view that diverges significantly from the simpler, more abstract ground truth diagram."
