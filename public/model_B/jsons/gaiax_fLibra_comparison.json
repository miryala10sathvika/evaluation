  "Clarity": {
    "rating": "Does Not Meet Expectations",
    "justification": "The generated diagram is a sequence diagram, which is a different type of diagram compared to the architecture diagram in the ground truth. This makes it difficult for stakeholders to understand the architecture as intended. The symbols and layout are not aligned with the architecture style, leading to potential confusion."

  "Completeness": {
    "rating": "Does Not Meet Expectations",
    "justification": "The generated diagram lacks several components and connections present in the ground truth, such as the Ethereum PoA Privatechain, Firestore, GAE, and AES. Instead, it focuses on user interactions and processes, which are not part of the original architecture diagram."

  "Consistency": {
    "rating": "Does Not Meet Expectations",
    "justification": "The generated diagram uses a completely different notation and style, focusing on sequence interactions rather than architectural components. This inconsistency in diagram type and elements makes it structurally and semantically misaligned with the ground truth."
