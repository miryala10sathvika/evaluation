  "Clarity": {
    "rating": "Partially Meets Expectations",
    "justification": "The generated diagram is a sequence diagram, which differs in format from the ground truth architecture diagram. While it provides detailed interaction flows, it may not be as immediately understandable to non-technical stakeholders as the architecture diagram. The labels and components are clear, but the layout is more complex."
  },
  "Completeness": {
    "rating": "Partially Meets Expectations",
    "justification": "The generated diagram includes many of the same components as the ground truth, such as services and databases, but it focuses on interaction flows rather than structural relationships. Some elements like the Notification Service are present, but the representation and focus differ significantly."
  },
  "Consistency": {
    "rating": "Does Not Meet Expectations",
    "justification": "The generated diagram uses a different style and notation (sequence diagram) compared to the ground truth (architecture diagram). This results in a lack of structural and semantic alignment. The symbols and layout are not consistent with the ground truth diagram's style."
