  "Clarity": {
    "rating": "Partially Meets Expectations",
    "justification": "The generated diagram uses a sequence diagram format, which is clear for technical stakeholders but might be less intuitive for non-technical stakeholders compared to the flowchart style of the ground truth. The labels and components are descriptive, but the complexity of the sequence diagram might reduce immediate clarity for all audiences."
  },
  "Completeness": {
    "rating": "Partially Meets Expectations",
    "justification": "The generated diagram captures the main components and interactions, such as AWS services and user actions. However, it lacks some visual elements present in the ground truth, like icons and graphical representations of services, which provide additional context and completeness."
  },
  "Consistency": {
    "rating": "Does Not Meet Expectations",
    "justification": "The generated diagram uses a different format (sequence diagram) compared to the flowchart style of the ground truth. This results in a lack of structural and semantic alignment. The notations and styles are not consistent with the ground truth, leading to potential confusion regarding the architecture's flow and components."
