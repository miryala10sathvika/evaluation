    "justification": "The generated diagram is significantly more complex and detailed than the ground truth. It includes numerous components, labels, and interactions that are not present in the ground truth, making it difficult for non-technical stakeholders to understand. The layout is also more intricate, which may hinder readability."

  "Completeness": {
    "rating": "Does Not Meet Expectations",
    "justification": "The generated diagram contains many additional elements and processes that are not in the ground truth. It lacks the simplicity and directness of the ground truth, which focuses on a straightforward flow from 'File' to 'TensorFlow'. The generated diagram introduces new components and processes, deviating from the original scope."

  "Consistency": {
    "rating": "Does Not Meet Expectations",
    "justification": "The generated diagram uses different styles, symbols, and notations compared to the ground truth. It does not maintain structural or semantic alignment with the ground truth, as it introduces new elements and a different flow, leading to inconsistencies in representation."
