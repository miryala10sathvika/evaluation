    "rating": "Does Not Meet Expectations",
    "justification": "The generated diagram lacks the architectural components and connections present in the ground truth, such as the data extraction, ingestion, storage, and warehouse components. It instead focuses on a detailed process flow, which is not aligned with the architecture overview."

    "rating": "Does Not Meet Expectations",
    "justification": "The generated diagram uses a different style and notation (sequence diagram) compared to the architecture diagram in the ground truth. There is no structural or semantic alignment between the two diagrams, leading to inconsistencies in representation."
