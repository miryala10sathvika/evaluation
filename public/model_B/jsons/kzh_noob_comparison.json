  "Completeness": {
    "rating": "Partially Meets Expectations",
    "justification": "The generated diagram includes most of the key components from the ground truth, such as microservices and infrastructure services. However, it lacks some details, such as specific connections and interactions between components, which are present in the ground truth."
