  "Clarity": {
    "rating": "Partially Meets Expectations",
    "justification": "The generated diagram uses clear labels and connections, but the complexity and number of elements may overwhelm non-technical stakeholders. The layout is logical, but the abundance of specific components might reduce overall clarity compared to the simpler ground truth diagram."
  },
  "Completeness": {
    "rating": "Does Not Meet Expectations",
    "justification": "The generated diagram includes many elements not present in the ground truth, such as specific scanners and configurations, and lacks some components like 'SDK' and 'interact system'. This results in a significant deviation from the ground truth."
  },
  "Consistency": {
    "rating": "Does Not Meet Expectations",
    "justification": "The styles and notations in the generated diagram differ significantly from the ground truth. The ground truth uses a color-coded and simplified style, while the generated diagram uses a more detailed and monochrome style, leading to inconsistency in representation."
