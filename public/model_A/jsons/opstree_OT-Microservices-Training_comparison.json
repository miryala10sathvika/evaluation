  "Clarity": {
    "rating": "Partially Meets Expectations",
    "justification": "The generated diagram uses a sequence diagram format, which is different from the component-based format of the ground truth. While the sequence diagram is clear in showing interactions, it may not be as easily understood by non-technical stakeholders unfamiliar with this format. The labels and components are clear, but the layout and style differ significantly from the ground truth."

  "Completeness": {
    "rating": "Partially Meets Expectations",
    "justification": "The generated diagram captures the main components and interactions, such as the Frontend, API Gateway, and various services. However, it lacks some specific elements and connections present in the ground truth, such as the Webserver and the specific data storage interactions with MySQL and Elasticsearch."
  },
  "Consistency": {
    "rating": "Does Not Meet Expectations",
    "justification": "The generated diagram uses a different style and format (sequence diagram) compared to the component-based architecture of the ground truth. This results in inconsistencies in how components and interactions are represented, leading to a lack of structural and semantic alignment."
