  "Clarity": {
    "rating": "Partially Meets Expectations",
    "justification": "The generated diagram uses a sequence diagram format, which is different from the flowchart style of the ground truth. While it is clear in terms of sequence of operations, it may not be as easily understandable to non-technical stakeholders due to its technical nature and lack of descriptive labels for each component."
  },
  "Completeness": {
    "rating": "Does Not Meet Expectations",
    "justification": "The generated diagram lacks several components present in the ground truth, such as 'Feature eng.', 'Model eval', and 'Model inference'. It also introduces new elements like 'ScaNN Service' and 'Google Ads API' which are not in the ground truth diagram."
  },
  "Consistency": {
    "rating": "Does Not Meet Expectations",
    "justification": "The generated diagram is not consistent with the ground truth in terms of structure and content. It uses a different diagram style (sequence vs. flowchart) and introduces new elements and processes not present in the ground truth, leading to structural and semantic misalignment."
