  "Clarity": {
    "rating": "Partially Meets Expectations",
    "justification": "The generated diagram uses icons and colors effectively, making it visually appealing. However, it lacks labels for connections and some components, making it less clear for non-technical stakeholders. The ground truth diagram provides more detailed labels and descriptions, aiding understanding."

  "Completeness": {
    "rating": "Does Not Meet Expectations",
    "justification": "The generated diagram is missing several components and connections present in the ground truth, such as the Jaeger Pod and detailed interactions between services. This omission results in a lack of critical information necessary for a complete understanding of the architecture."
  },
  "Consistency": {
    "rating": "Partially Meets Expectations",
    "justification": "The generated diagram maintains a consistent style with icons and colors, but it does not align structurally with the ground truth. Some components are represented differently, and the lack of detailed labels and connections affects semantic consistency."
