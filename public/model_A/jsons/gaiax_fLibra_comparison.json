  "Clarity": {
    "rating": "Partially Meets Expectations",
    "justification": "The generated diagram is a sequence diagram, which is a different type from the ground truth architecture diagram. While it provides detailed interactions, it may not be immediately understandable to non-technical stakeholders looking for an overview of the system architecture. The labels and components are clear, but the format shift affects overall clarity for the intended purpose."

  "Completeness": {
    "rating": "Does Not Meet Expectations",
    "justification": "The generated diagram is missing several components from the ground truth, such as GAE and AES. It also includes additional components like IPFS and Elasticsearch that are not present in the ground truth. The interactions depicted do not cover all the connections shown in the ground truth diagram."
  },
  "Consistency": {
    "rating": "Does Not Meet Expectations",
    "justification": "The generated diagram uses a different style and notation (sequence diagram) compared to the ground truth (architecture diagram). The components and interactions are not consistently represented between the two diagrams, leading to structural and semantic misalignment."
