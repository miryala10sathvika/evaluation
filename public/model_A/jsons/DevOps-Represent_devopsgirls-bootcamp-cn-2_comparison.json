  "Clarity": {
    "rating": "Partially Meets Expectations",
    "justification": "The generated diagram uses technical terms and AWS-specific icons, which may not be immediately clear to non-technical stakeholders. However, it provides detailed labels and descriptions for each component, which aids understanding. The layout is logical, but the inclusion of technical jargon could be simplified for broader clarity."
  },
  "Completeness": {
    "rating": "Partially Meets Expectations",
    "justification": "The generated diagram includes most of the components from the ground truth, such as API Gateway, Lambda Function, and S3. However, it introduces DynamoDB, which is not present in the ground truth, and lacks the explicit 'User Interface' component. The connections and operations are more detailed, but some elements are missing or added unnecessarily."
  },
  "Consistency": {
    "rating": "Partially Meets Expectations",
    "justification": "The generated diagram uses consistent AWS icons and styles, but it differs from the ground truth in terms of structure and some components. The additional details and different layout create inconsistencies with the ground truth, although the core elements are represented."
