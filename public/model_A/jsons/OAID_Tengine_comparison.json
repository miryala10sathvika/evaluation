  "Clarity": {
    "rating": "Partially Meets Expectations",
    "justification": "The generated diagram is somewhat clear but uses different terminology and structure compared to the ground truth. While it includes labels and connections, the naming and arrangement differ significantly, which might confuse stakeholders familiar with the original diagram."
  },
  "Completeness": {
    "rating": "Does Not Meet Expectations",
    "justification": "The generated diagram lacks several components present in the ground truth, such as specific serializers and runtime optimizations. It introduces new elements like 'Inference Engine' and 'Operator Library' that are not in the original, indicating a major deviation from the expected content."
  },
  "Consistency": {
    "rating": "Does Not Meet Expectations",
    "justification": "There is a lack of consistency between the two diagrams. The symbols, styles, and notations used are different, and the structural alignment with the ground truth is poor. The generated diagram does not maintain the same visual or semantic consistency as the original."
