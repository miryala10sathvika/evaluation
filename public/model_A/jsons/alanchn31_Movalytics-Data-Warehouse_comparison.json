    "rating": "Does Not Meet Expectations",
    "justification": "The generated diagram lacks several elements from the ground truth, such as the specific flow of data between components and the use of Amazon EC2. It also introduces new elements not present in the ground truth, such as specific dataset names and data quality checks."

  "Consistency": {
    "rating": "Does Not Meet Expectations",
    "justification": "The generated diagram uses a different notation style (sequence diagram) compared to the ground truth (component diagram). The symbols, layout, and connections are not consistent with the ground truth, leading to a lack of structural and semantic alignment."
